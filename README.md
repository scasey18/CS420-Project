Status:
1. There is a working file tab and ability to import and export saved farms but you cannot update them until you do a name update and then undo it for every node then it works fine
2. I have saved UIManager values for a darkmode in the darkmode class
3. Farm was created to have an easier way to store all the information as it was easier and uses less space than saving the entire instance
